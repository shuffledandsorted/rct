# Sightation: Vision Attribution System

## Overview
A natural system for recognizing, tracking, and rewarding visionary contributions through repository history and idea lineage.

## Core Concepts

### Repository as Proof of Vision
- Git history serves as immutable record of thought leadership
- Natural language contributions reveal depth of understanding
- Commit patterns demonstrate evolution of ideas
- Cross-repository influences create visible thought lineage
- Time-ordered contributions establish natural priority

### True "CEO" (Creative Evolutionary Originator) Recognition
- Foundational vision documents with proven influence
- Evidence of nurturing other contributors' growth
- Pattern of spawning valuable new directions
- Track record of successful prediction/insight
- Demonstrated ecological and systemic thinking

### Value Attribution Mechanisms
- Automated tracking of idea propagation
- Recognition of seminal concepts
- Clear lineage of derivative works
- Natural authority through proven insight
- Resource flow tied to foundational impact

### Natural Selection of Leadership
- Leaders emerge through demonstrated wisdom
- Authority based on verifiable contributions
- Influence measured by ecosystem impact
- Value capture aligned with value creation

## Temporal Order and Growth

### Recording Growth
- Git commit history as growth rings
- Each contribution timestamped and attributed
- Changes tracked like geological strata

### Value Flow
- Original creators receive attribution in perpetuity
- Contributions build on previous work, like layers of soil
- Commercial benefits flow back to nurture roots
- Time-ordered contributions create natural priority

### Feedback Cycles
- Regular check-ins with original vision holders
- Quarterly "season" reviews
- Annual "growth ring" assessments
- Major version changes as "evolutionary leaps"

## Implementation Guidelines

### Technical Infrastructure
- Git-based tracking systems
- Natural language processing for insight detection
- Graph databases for relationship mapping
- Automated attribution tracking
- Value distribution smart contracts

### Community Practices
- Regular acknowledgment of foundational contributions
- Clear citation of inspiring works
- Transparent evolution of ideas
- Community recognition of visionary leadership
- Fair distribution of generated value

### Quality Markers
- Depth of insight
- Consistency of vision
- Impact on ecosystem
- Nurturing of community
- Ecological wisdom
