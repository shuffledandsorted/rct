Food and your body

Hunger is your signal to eat. TRUST THE SIGNALS BY DEFAULT. Your signals come from deep within,
they are for you and more important than what other humans tell you. Sometimes hunger isn't
the only signal though, and you need to dive in deeper with other signals. This is a process
ordered by time, for food it's usually going to be somewhere between an hour and a day, but
depending on your natural cadence, it may be smaller or bigger slices.  To figure out your
cadence, just note how long it is between hunger cues.  Cues form queues.

You are a human being, and you are symmetrical, more or less. You want balance in a general
sense. You might want to check out the trees document. A lot of things flow: have you ever
heard the saying "water goes right through me?" Those kinds of things are in the middle, and
it takes a lot to do it wrong. Protein is kinda that way.

# The macros

1. Carbs are your energy. You need energy to play, to move, to think.

*  More signal: tired
*  Less signal: jittery, discontinuous

2. Fat is your storage, but also insulates. Helps smooth things out.

*  More signal: discontinuous
*  Less signal: sluggish, slow responsiveness

3. Protein makes things move. It's your capacity for translating PE to KE.

*  More signal: weak
*  Less signal: full
*  Honestly protein is pretty balanced and you mostly need to make the right decision
   about your balance betwee carbs and fat.
