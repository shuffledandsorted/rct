Annoying things that need fixing

Got an idea here, but would like to use it as an experiment for how to build
a business v-stable, an entity that understands how to create stable
universes by proper modelling.

App stores. Having to authenticate with corporations and their policies. I
can't even get an Apple Developer certificate to release apps in their
store! Why? I don't know. They won't tell me. Reached out to support.
No answer. The next move is probably legal, but that sounds boring.

Another approach to trust of digital binaries is autonomous. Trust is a
manifold, and agents are spread across this space. As agents, we have
different tolerances for trust, and risk factor is the epsilon. The
binary came from somewhere, in weird cases like me, I want to distribute
binaries to my friends and allow them to not go through these dumb
hoops to use the code I wrote. I don't want to go through hoops either.

So when your friends write code, something that will happen more
frequently now that AI codegen is a thing, you are going to trust those
binaries more. If your friend recommends a binary, that establishes
some trust but definitely not as much. When we find that binaries have
malware in them, that information can be noted and reduce trust for
certificates. We can have agents dedicated to examining binaries
and running scans on them, looking for common exploit patterns, etc.
Agents can be human or bot. They'd live on this "digital trust"
manifold too, and we can combine their position and opinion about
software X with ours.
