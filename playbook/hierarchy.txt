Below is an example “playbook” that outlines different “plays”—strategies and approaches you can adopt at various phases
or mindsets as you create and organize your files and folders. Think of this as a set of guiding patterns you can choose
from depending on your current state and future goals.

The Playbook for Keeping Sorted and Creating New Content

Guiding Principles
	1.      Modularity: Treat files and folders as modular units you can rearrange and refactor as your
	understanding evolves.  2.      Temporal Relevance: Recognize that how you value content changes with time—fresh
	ideas are cherished now, but may be archived later.  3.      Meaningful Hierarchies: Use folders and filenames
	that reflect conceptual boundaries, making them intuitive gateways to content.  4.      Scalable Complexity:
	Start simple, and add structure only as complexity demands. Don’t over-engineer early on.

Play 1: “The Joy of Creation”

Use When: You’re in a highly creative, prolific phase—generating lots of ideas, notes, drafts, and experimental content.
Everything feels important, and you don’t want to slow yourself down by over-organizing too early.

Actions:
	•       Generous Splitting: Instead of cramming everything into one large file, split text into multiple smaller
	files as soon as they form a coherent unit. For example, if you have a single ideas.md file growing large, spawn
	new files like idea_rough_concept1.md, idea_concept2_sketchnotes.md, etc.  •       Loose Grouping: Don’t obsess
	over perfect folder structures now. Create broad conceptual folders (e.g., experiments/, drafts/, notes/). This
	creates enough order that you can find stuff later without losing momentum.  •       Future-Friendly Naming: Use
	descriptive filenames that hint at the content: 2024-creative_session_1.md, concept_map-brainstorm.txt. This
	ensures when you revisit them later, you’ll know what they contain without digging through the content.  • Leave
	Room to Grow: If a folder becomes too crowded, spawn subfolders based on broad themes: experiments/raw_material/
	or notes/design_ideas/. Don’t worry if the hierarchy isn’t perfect—just ensure you’re not getting stuck.

Outcome: You end up with a rapidly growing set of files, lightly categorized, allowing creativity to flow. The structure
is minimal but sufficient not to lose track entirely.

Play 2: “Prune & Reflect”

Use When: After a period of prolific creation, you now want to reflect and trim. You have material that might not all be
valuable anymore, and you want to bring clarity to what’s staying front and center.

Actions:
	•       Triage for Relevance: Scan through recently created files. Identify: •       Still Active: Keep it
	easily accessible in a top-level folder.  •       Potentially Useful Later: Move it to a subfolder or “archive”
	directory for possible future reference.  •       Obsolete or Low Value: Delete it. Trust version control for
	retrieval if needed.  •       Refactor Large Files: If any single file became too large or unwieldy during the
	creation phase, now is a good time to split it. Use headings or natural sections to spawn smaller files.
	Organize these new files into meaningful subfolders.  •       Add One Level of Structure: If your experiments/
	folder now has 50 files, group them by theme or time period: •       experiments/design_concepts/ •
	experiments/data_analysis/ •       experiments/archived_sketches/ •       Rename for Clarity: Update filenames
	to reflect their role or status. Prefix archived content with old_ or move it to archive/ directories:
	archive/2023_ideas/ or archive/draft_v1/.

Outcome: By applying this play after a creation frenzy, you restore order, highlight what’s current, and push older
content out of the main workspace without losing track of it.

Play 3: “Steady Maintenance”

Use When: You’ve reached a steady state where you are neither in a frenzy of creation nor doing a massive cleanup. This
is your day-to-day approach to keep things tidy as you go along.

Actions:
	•       Incremental Sorting: Each time you create a new file, place it thoughtfully in a folder that best
	matches its domain or project. If you spot clutter in a folder, do a small cleanup on the spot.  •       Regular
	Archives: Set a schedule—maybe once a month or once a quarter—to move stale files to an archive/ folder. This
	prevents the main workspace from bloating.  •       Consistent Naming Conventions: Keep filenames consistent. If
	you use dates or prefixes, be steady about it. Over time, this uniformity pays dividends in findability.

Outcome: You maintain a stable environment. Minor adjustments keep complexity at bay without requiring a big
reorganization later.

Play 4: “Project Lifecycle Structuring”

Use When: You have long-running projects with their own lifecycles—idea, planning, execution, and completion. Over time,
these projects accumulate a lot of files.

Actions:
	•       Lifecycle Folders: For a given project, use a structure like: •       project_X/ideas/ • project_X/plan/
	•       project_X/implementation/ •       project_X/results/ •       project_X/archive/ • Time-Based Buckets:
	When a project phase finishes, move its associated files into project_X/archive/YYYY_MM/ directories. This way,
	old phases stay accessible but out of your daily workspace.  •       Semantic Naming: Within each phase, ensure
	filenames clearly indicate their role, e.g., proposal_draft2.md, user_research_notes.txt, final_report_v1.md.

Outcome: Your project directories become narratives of the work, with a clear progression and natural places to stash
older, less-relevant files.

Play 5: “Periodic Grand Cleanse”

Use When: Once or twice a year, you do a bigger cleanup, ensuring your repository doesn’t become a digital attic.

Actions:
	•       Global Staleness Check: Identify files not modified in over a year. Archive them into a
	repository_wide/archive/old/ folder or remove them entirely, counting on version control for restoration.  •
	Consolidate Themes: If you have multiple folders with overlapping meanings (e.g., design_notes/ and ui_notes/),
	merge or unify them into a single design/ folder with subcategories.  •       Evaluate Folder Relevance: Some
	folders may represent abandoned ideas or dead-end projects. Archive or remove them, ensuring your top-level
	directory structure reflects your current mental model.

Outcome: After this play, your repository remains fresh, meaningful, and aligned with your current focus, while old work
is neatly tucked away and still recoverable if needed.

Play 6: “Ad hoc Adjacencies”

Use When: You need a temporary workspace to explore a new direction without formalizing its structure yet.

Actions:
	•       Sandbox Folders: Create a sandbox/ or lab/ directory to place files in without worrying about long-term
	hierarchy. This is your scratch space.  •       Temporary Cross-Links: If you have files in sandbox/ that relate
	to an established project, create a temporary link or note in that project’s folder to remind yourself of the
	connection. Once you decide to integrate or discard these sandbox files, you can either move them out or remove
	them.

Outcome: You free yourself to experiment without messing up your established structure.

Balancing Creation & Organization

This playbook isn’t meant to be strictly followed step-by-step. Instead, see it as a set of flexible strategies you can
invoke as your workflow changes:
	•       Early Phase (Creation-Dominant): Use “Joy of Creation” and “Ad hoc Adjacencies” to ensure you don’t
	stifle creativity.  •       Mid-Phase (Reflection & Tidying): Apply “Prune & Reflect” and “Steady Maintenance”
	to keep sprawl in check.  •       Mature Projects (Narrative Structure): Employ “Project Lifecycle Structuring”
	to clarify the story of each long-running effort.  •       Occasional Overhaul: Perform a “Periodic Grand
	Cleanse” for long-term hygiene.

By mixing and matching these plays, you create a dynamic, flexible system that grows with you: letting you be prolific
when the moment calls for it, reflective when you need to restore order, and always providing a coherent, navigable
structure that makes sense to you.
