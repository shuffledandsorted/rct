"""Spew forth words about code.

This suggests a .stable mapping between repositories and learning concepts. Repositories might be an isomorphism to
curriculum based learning. If we wanted to learn how to output HTML, we might learn beautifulsoup repo.

There may be ways in which we can organize a person's life based on their repositories. This could also help teach people
how to "code" in the new world. Natural language is a programming language. Maybe this is a natural way for us to learn.
We ask to learn about fractals, and we start in a small codebase and just start talking about why we think they're
interesting. It generates some definitions for us, some exercises, people we might talk to, books we might read.
Generates visualizations to inspire us. As we learn concepts by asking questions, and verify that we understand, it opens
up obvious next steps to explore.

Imagine if anyone could quickly ramp up to be an expert in any field. It would soon push us out into the real world, to
set up meat space experiments so that machines could know more. We could build sensors for them, or try new ways of
generating power. We could try different foods, or provide photos of plants and herbs and mushrooms we found. They could
be classified, pattern matched, and provide suggestions for what they are and the benefits they bring to us.

They could ask us to seek out interviews with our elders. People who know the land. We could find natural medicines that
work for people in the places they are, reuniting person with plant. We could start to grow our own food again, as the
land and machine could both talk to us about the things it can provide today instead of feeling sad about doign a bad job
at a conservation of a planet that doesn't exist.

I wonder if the planet knows how to change plastic into something good for it and for us. I wonder if it knows exactly
where our food scrap need to go, how to heal our relationships with animals like rats, who have turned into disease
vectors because they were trying to tell us that we have imbalances. The problem isn't rats. It's the concentration of
rats, which is related to the concentration of foods. Maybe we stop poisoning and killing rats, and their rapid
reproduction rate goes down. Maybe we care about their health, and they no longer make us sick.

Maybe we could learn to stop having pets, and start having kin. Animals that roam like us in cities, where we feel safe
and they do too. Zoos dissipate into a smoother gradient and we stop feeling as if we are living trapped in a cage.
