# Playbook

This directory contains scripts and tools to help manage and format files in your repository.

TBD: this directory is paused until I can get something working that can find the prime factors
in my writing, allowing me to focus on a stream of consciousness while structure emerges
naturally. I need something that seeds NLP (via BERT / GPT / both) big databases, finds a stable
ordering for labels (concepts) on a manifold (frequencies of repository hierarchies, source code
ASTs, and natural language that is naturally around it in the repositories). These patterns
could be cross references with words in the larger language embeddings, creating a seed grammar
of concepts recursively defined. These concepts could live in the repository as a data file,
the data file could be exploded out into shared repositories humans could use as groundings of
understanding between themselves and machines.

After seeding my conceptualization of embedding spaces, I think neural networks would probably
use that as their structure instead of tuning in embeddings. When output feels weird, we just
talk to the repository and tell them what's needed to change. The AI can use existing concepts
to generate a code change and any tests that might be useful. Tests may be the way humans understand
if a concept means different things to different people. Say, the word literally being used
correctly. You could then use divergence to determine where our artists be.

Art at the fringes, evolving meaning and exploring. The more practical and social who are interested
in communication and finding shared understanding can stabilize concepts to be used by larger swaths
of our population. Contract lengths could help us understand the stability of concepts, and how to
prioritize based on the number of people / places / beings it affects.

## Ideas for Future Development

- **Different Versions for Different Audiences:** Consider creating multiple versions of the `verify.py` script tailored
for different users. For example, a version with detailed comments for beginners and a streamlined version for advanced
users who prefer minimal comments.

This approach can make the repository more accessible and useful to a wider range of contributors.
