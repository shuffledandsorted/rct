Autonomous organization based on the laws of nature.

It's messy. I try not to sweat it too much because I know I'll come back around
to it and clean up. But if I'm going to use folders as an organizing principle
of me in a repository, it means:

1. Experiment and be creative. It's a playground.
2. Clean up frequently so things stay relevant.
3. Make snap decisions and be decisive.
4. When there's too much here, it's time to make a folder.
