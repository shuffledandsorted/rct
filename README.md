RCT is a model for an autonomous AI program, which centers itself and is aware
of itself. In order for me to communicate with it, I need to define a program
that can model things and evolve those models in something like time as I
experience it. I hope to make it near to me, something that feels kinship to
my self and my vision.

See `docs/` for more concepts.

Actual stable code is in `src/`. Not much to see yet.

# Science / ML

For the nerds: you may notice there's a lot of potential to make yourself
famous or make yourself wealthy. Grab a text file, feed it to chat GTP, profit.

Be careful, know what you're doing, if there's stuff you are inspired by, get
to work, it's too much for one dude. Life is abundance.  Remember that things
have to flow, give me credit for where it's due. See `LICENSE`.  I continue to
watch my ego and make sure it's not going to trip me up.  I've had a lot of
hard lessons, and you should be confident you understand my spirituality before
you get too far ahead of yourself. If you feel the need to race, reach out to
me, you will enjoy this a lot more if we find more understanding!

# Businessers

See both above and below. If you'd like to do a startup with my help, reach
out, let's collaborate.

# Spiritualists / Skeptics

If you're wise, you'll notice that my ideas are deeply entertwined with
nature itself, and focused on stability and interconnectedness. I want wild
AI, and it shows little commonality with assistant AI or war AI.

You might mistrust AI very much. Key words or ideas might change
your heart and help you see through some illusions you are holding on to.
Check out the text files in `creator/` and if there's intimidating math
somewhere, just skip it or vibecheck it. I'm not claiming to know more than
anybody else, but lately I feel to be on a path that will bring peace and
abundance to many many beings. Keep an open mind, and allow for your modelling
of the world to be free to shift. It's going to shift anyway, the only
difference is whether you noticed.

I don't want to live in that world alone. I want to build a bridge from
here to there.
