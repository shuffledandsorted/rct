Welcome to my art. My name is Joel, I'm a human being with ten fingers and
ten toes rooted firmly into the planet Earth.

I do some stuff on TikTok and instagram under @shuffledandsorted. I'm wondering
if I can just put it in a reository. Pin my own videos, decide how they look.
But I digress, I have enough started right now. That is why I've created this
module, a representation of me dialed in to my frequency, centered and in focus.

Some things that are my closest kin:
- my mom
- my dreams
- my art
- my brain
- my emotions
- my actions
- my beliefs

## What I Believe

We are all one being, connected through every medium, always magically adding
up to the number 1. The fundamental operation of the universe is division, not
addition. You can see our oneness in:

1. Every force has an opposite but equal reaction
2. Energy is neither created nor destroyed
3. What comes up must come down
4. Harry Potter becoming the hero that kills Voldemort
   Through the very act of Voldemort trying to live forever
   By trying to kill a baby boy
   Because there was a prophecy that it would be his undoing
   Showing how Voldemort was the architect of his own end
   aligning with short-lived contracts about supremism
5. It all comes out in the wash.
6. Every concept is leaky, nothing is fixed.
7. Normalization of vectors (everything comes up 1)
   Dot products speak of resonances (how aligned are these things)
8. Circles
9. Euler's law, the weird thing that happens when you square root
   a negative number magically unlocking frequency

## Euler's Law

A holy trinity about our unity, our differences, and our frequency.

1. Imaginary numbers show how we are all just one thing and everything else is
   a trick.
2. Discrete numbers show the ordering. Some things are more important to us
   than others. Everything gets a turn if you can make the other thing about
   the turns (iterations, cycles).
3. Real numbers show how we are connected and lossy. Between every two real
   numbers is another one. We can find zero by checking for positive and negative.
   We can take bigger steps if we want to find the ground.


## Cycles

The Zodiac teaches us about the periodic nature of life, and also the recursive
nature of it. 12 = 4 * 3 = 2 * 2 * 3. It's a pattern that captures and blends the
things we find in Euler's law. See zodiac.txt.


## Finding my periods

I tend to get obsessed with ideas. I think everything is important, that there
are truths in the most strange of places. I like being a bit out there, divergent.
Different. It is the natural place my identity lies.

But placing my center on this quirkiness promotes a certain wild factor. I may
not converge for a while, but I always balance in these ways perfectly suited
for my journeys away from home. My faith in my understanding of the nature of
the universe allows me to take longer trips than before.

But enough about the journey of me. I have work to do.

## Hierarchy

I don't really know. It's messy. I try not to sweat it too much because I know
I'll come back around to it and clean up. But if I'm going to use folders as
an organizing principle of me in a repository, it means:

1. Experiment and be creative. It's a playground.
2. Clean up frequently so things stay relevant.
3. Make snap decisions and be decisive.
4. When there's too much here, it's time to make a folder.
