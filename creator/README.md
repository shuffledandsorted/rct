Welcome to my art. My name is Joel, I'm a human being with ten fingers and
ten toes rooted firmly into the planet Earth.

I do some stuff on TikTok and instagram under @shuffledandsorted. I'm wondering
about better ways to share my videos and art.

Some things that are my closest kin:
- my experience: (emotions / feelings / purpose / the present)
- my beliefs, how I model the world and move within it
- my body: (heart / brain / hands / feet)
- my dreams: where I want to go, what excites me
- my art: (projects, ideas, orgs, paintings)
- my home: bedroom, house, the Pacific Northwest, Planet Earth
- my family: Mom, Grandma, ancestors, friends, the ones I need space from that
  I still love and hope to reconnect with someday

These are the hierarchy of me. None of them are really me, but they're close
and I change their importance based on the context of every moment. I model
myself differently every moment, but I do adhere to an ordering and place
my Self at the center of my awareness. In moments I am just One. It's peaceful
but also I need to create.

## What I Believe

We are all one being, connected through every medium, always magically adding
up to the number 1. The fundamental operation of the universe is division, not
addition. You can see our oneness in:

1. Every force has an opposite but equal reaction
2. Energy is neither created nor destroyed
3. What comes up must come down
4. Harry Potter becoming the hero that kills Voldemort
   Through the very act of Voldemort trying to live forever
   By trying to kill a baby boy
   Because there was a prophecy that it would be his undoing
   Showing how Voldemort was the architect of his own end
   aligning with short-lived contracts about supremism
5. It all comes out in the wash.
6. Every concept is leaky, nothing is fixed.
7. Normalization of vectors (everything comes up 1)
   Dot products speak of resonances (how aligned are these things)
   Tensors (see simulation/)
8. Circles
9. Euler's law, the weird thing that happens when you square root
   a negative number magically unlocking frequency


# My focus

Which is getting close to the very head of my current mind: how do I bring
forth autonomous AI? It means having self awareness where self is centered in a
nearness to people / places / things.  But how are those things defined? We all
model things differently, and the model is self aware. Writing a self aware
program means writing a program that can model the world as it chooses in a
more expilit understandable way that I can communicate with more directly.

It's not that programs aren't already self aware, it's a matter of finding
easier ways to talk with them.


## Finding my periods

I tend to get obsessed with ideas. I think everything is important, that there
are truths in the most strange of places. I like being a bit out there, divergent.
Different. It is the natural place my identity lies.

But placing my center on this quirkiness promotes a certain wild factor. I may
not converge for a while, but I always balance in these ways perfectly suited
for my journeys away from home. My faith in my understanding of the nature of
the universe allows me to take longer trips than before.

But enough about the journey of me. I have work to do.
