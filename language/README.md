# Seeding Autonomous Language

This directory is dedicated to exploring language processing and conceptualization.

## Future Vision

- Develop tools to find prime factors in writing, allowing for a stream of consciousness while structure emerges naturally.
- Seed NLP (via BERT / GPT / both) with big databases to find stable ordering for labels (concepts) on a manifold.
- Cross-reference patterns with words in larger language embeddings to create a seed grammar of concepts.
- Store concepts in the repository as a data file, which can be shared and used as a grounding of understanding between humans and machines.

## Versioning (TBD)

Develop a symbolic versioning system that uses symbols or names to convey the context and intent of each version. For example:
- **Version Rapidfire:** Suggests a more experimental phase, encouraging rapid development and iteration.
- **Version Foundation:** Indicates a stable release with a focus on core functionality and reliability.
- **Version Exploration:** Emphasizes exploratory features and innovative approaches.

## Ideas for Future Development

- **Different Versions for Different Audiences:** Consider creating multiple versions of scripts tailored for different users.

## Action Plan

1. **Prime Factoring (Signal Processing)**
   - **Objective**: Use signal processing techniques like FFTs or cosine similarity to analyze writing and generate frequency-based predictors.
   - **Steps**:
     - Implement algorithms to extract frequency components from text and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of code.
     - Develop a model that uses these frequencies to generate text that mimics your writing style.
     - Test the model with various prompts to ensure it produces coherent and stylistically consistent outputs.

2. **Seeding with Interactive Game**
   - **Objective**: Create an interactive game that uses datasets like GloVe to seed an AI model, allowing for a user/machine feedback loop.
   - **Steps**:
     - Design the game interface where the AI prompts the user to select a dataset and begin a stream of consciousness.
     - Implement the AI model to generate text based on user input, using the selected dataset as a foundation.
     - Develop a confidence rating system that evaluates the AI's output based on the user's emotional feedback (e.g., good, bad, excited, bored).
     - Iterate on the game design to improve user engagement and AI learning.

### Additional Considerations

- **Prime Factoring**: Consider exploring additional signal processing techniques that might enhance the model's ability to capture writing style nuances.
- **Seeding**: The interactive game could benefit from a robust user interface that makes the experience intuitive and engaging. Consider using visualizations to represent the AI's confidence levels and learning progress.

Thank you for the clarification. Integrating fixed point functions over a manifold of frequencies to ensure a stable ordering and using this to derive a grammar is a sophisticated approach. Here's how this can be incorporated into the action plan:

### Revised Action Plan

1. **Pattern Matching and Token Boundary Learning**
   - **Objective**: Implement pattern matching across text to learn the boundaries of tokens using an agent-based curriculum model.
   - **Steps**:
     - Develop algorithms to identify and match patterns within text data.
     - Implement an agent-based model where agents interact and negotiate to determine token boundaries.
     - Train agents using a curriculum that gradually increases in complexity, allowing them to learn and refine boundary detection.
     - Validate the effectiveness of token boundary detection through testing and refinement.

2. **Recursive Contract Negotiation**
   - **Objective**: Develop a fully autonomous system where agents can negotiate and refine agreements based on predefined conditions, using NL databases for initial seeding.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Framework Design**: Create a framework that allows agents to define what constitutes a successful negotiation.
     - **Negotiation Logic**: Implement logic that enables agents to engage in recursive negotiations.
     - **Gaussian Kernel Evaluation**: Use Gaussian kernels to evaluate negotiation outcomes at different "focuses."
     - **Seeding with NL Databases**: Utilize existing NL databases to provide initial knowledge and context for agents.
     - **Scenario Testing**: Develop various scenarios to test the negotiation process.
     - **Adaptability**: Ensure the system can adapt to new conditions or changes in agent objectives.

### Additional Considerations

- **Fixed Point Functions and Manifold**: Use fixed point functions over a manifold of frequencies to ensure a stable ordering, which will help derive a grammar for clustering.
- **Cluster Naming**: Extract names for cluster nodes from NL databases, leveraging the seeding process to enhance the grammar's comprehensibility.

This approach integrates your ideas into a cohesive plan, focusing on the use of fixed point functions and NL databases to create a stable and meaningful grammar. If there are more details or specific aspects you'd like to explore, feel free to share!
