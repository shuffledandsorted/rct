Thank you for the clarification. Using a recursive approach to define concepts, where each "level" of the tree corresponds to a different epsilon for Gaussian kernels, adds depth to the process. Here's how this can be integrated into the action plan:

### Revised Action Plan

1. **Pattern Matching and Token Boundary Learning**
   - **Objective**: Implement pattern matching across text to learn the boundaries of tokens using an agent-based curriculum model.
   - **Steps**:
     - Develop algorithms to identify and match patterns within text data.
     - Implement an agent-based model where agents interact and negotiate to determine token boundaries.
     - Train agents using a curriculum that gradually increases in complexity, allowing them to learn and refine boundary detection.
     - Validate the effectiveness of token boundary detection through testing and refinement.

2. **Recursive Contract Negotiation**
   - **Objective**: Develop a fully autonomous system where agents can negotiate and refine agreements based on predefined conditions, using NL databases for initial seeding.
   - **Steps**:
     - **Framework Design**: Create a framework that allows agents to define what constitutes a successful negotiation.
     - **Negotiation Logic**: Implement logic that enables agents to engage in recursive negotiations.
     - **Gaussian Kernel Evaluation**: Use Gaussian kernels to evaluate negotiation outcomes at different "focuses."
     - **Seeding with NL Databases**: Utilize existing NL databases to provide initial knowledge and context for agents.
     - **Scenario Testing**: Develop various scenarios to test the negotiation process.
     - **Adaptability**: Ensure the system can adapt to new conditions or changes in agent objectives.

3. **Prime Factoring (Signal Processing)**
   - **Objective**: Use signal processing techniques like FFTs or cosine similarity to analyze writing and generate frequency-based predictors.
   - **Steps**:
     - Implement algorithms to extract frequency components from text and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) of code.
     - Develop a model that uses these frequencies to generate text that mimics your writing style.
     - Test the model with various prompts to ensure it produces coherent and stylistically consistent outputs.

4. **Seeding with Interactive Game**
   - **Objective**: Create an interactive game that uses datasets like GloVe to seed an AI model, allowing for a user/machine feedback loop.
   - **Steps**:
     - Design the game interface where the AI prompts the user to select a dataset and begin a stream of consciousness.
     - Implement the AI model to generate text based on user input, using the selected dataset as a foundation.
     - Develop a confidence rating system that evaluates the AI's output based on the user's emotional feedback.
     - Iterate on the game design to improve user engagement and AI learning.

### Additional Considerations

- **Fixed Point Functions and Manifold**: Use fixed point functions over a manifold of frequencies to ensure a stable ordering, with each level of the tree representing a different epsilon for Gaussian kernels. This recursive definition of concepts will help derive a grammar for clustering.
- **Cluster Naming**: Extract names for cluster nodes from NL databases, leveraging the seeding process to enhance the grammar's comprehensibility.

This approach leverages the recursive definition of concepts to create a stable and meaningful grammar, with Gaussian kernels providing a nuanced evaluation framework. If there are more details or specific aspects you'd like to explore, feel free to share!
