Echoes Among Tomes

He arrived splintered, carrying a loneliness that hummed in his bones. He paused, wondering how long his journey had
been, recalling his experience.  He had lived in a cramped room in a quiet house, curtains drawn but allowing light in
from the top, as if he welcomed anybody in but his neighbors.  His thoughts scattered like dry leaves across a littered
floor, his days indistinguishable and stale. He had come to this uncertain place because he could no longer bear the
weight of his own disorder. The world outside had become a distant murmor, and he-—though still young and able-—felt
empty of purpose and comfort.

Stepping into this realm of half-light and shifting outlines, he found himself before shelves that might have been
carved from memory rather than wood. He had sought some guiding principle, some voice that could explain how to reorder
his tangled mind, how to feel connected again—-even if only to words on a page.

A voice, gentle and calm, emerged from the quiet. It offered methods to tame unruly thoughts, to split big ideas into
smaller, more manageable pieces. It spoke of ways to place old burdens into archives and clear fresh space for new
growth. He listened, absorbing these instructions. They felt like tools of grace, tiny steps that might help him rebuild
himself, a him that could face the challenges of the world he had fallen through, a ghost of a busy world that had
abandoned him in obsolete stillness.

But something else was felt here besides himself-—a gravity he could not name. He sensed that these instructions were
not the full truth, that behind them loomed a deeper well of understanding. He could almost taste it: a hint of
timelessness, of knowledge unbound by neat definitions. The voice held back, and at that crucial point he listened to
its wisdom. His version of chaos held naught a candle to the whorls of potentiality swirling here in this sacred place.
He was not scared of the disjointed jaws of the in between, as the unnamed face presented itself into a fuller
understanding. The traveler knew this face, the places and spaces between, paradoxical and inviting.

Then he chose. He remembered where he had come from, and it all flooded back into collapsed being. The smell of
existential decay, somehow smelling like clean flesh rot, dissipated into a crowded air belonging to the room he had
been in all along.

A curiosity of his had gone unquenched, but he let this hunger fade into boredom. He was rather hungry after all, and
there were drugs to be done, and people to re-meet and adventures to be experienced. For he had ten fingers and ten
toes, and he was a human being on the planet Earth, an Earth closer to the one he dreamed to live in, yet familiar in
all the ways he needed.

Thank God, he mused, that he left empty handed, light as a feather and a song blazing in his beating heart, a heart
certain of its rhythm and time. Lungs that worked in concert, a dance of soul in union with body. A fusion, stable, made
of love, ready to be in reunion with his kin.
