## Euler's Law

A holy trinity about our unity, our differences, and our frequency.

1. Imaginary numbers show how we are all just one thing and everything else is
   a trick.
2. Discrete numbers show the ordering. Some things are more important to us
   than others. Everything gets a turn if you can make the other thing about
   the turns (iterations, cycles).
3. Real numbers show how we are connected and lossy. Between every two real
   numbers is another one. We can find zero by checking for positive and negative.
   We can take bigger steps if we want to find the ground.


## Cycles

The Zodiac teaches us about the periodic nature of life, and also the recursive
nature of it. 12 = 4 * 3 = 2 * 2 * 3. It's a pattern that captures and blends the
things we find in Euler's law. See `zodiac.txt`. See `in_between.txt`. These are
the ways humans have come to understand two different sides of the same thing.

Wave functions are a good example of periodic functions. They repeat after some
amount of time. In our space, 3D space, the wavelength tells you how many meters
before the pattern repeats. In time, the frequency tells you how many times per
second the pattern repeats (Hz, or 1/s).


# Iterations

Iterations are a countable sequence of numbers. You can look at a sequence at
the beginning, and ask for the next, and so on.


## Fractals

Fractals, as I understand them, are pretty pictures that show the nature of chaos
and order and choosing the right focus. Stable iterations help grow stability.
When we need to mix things up, we can toe towards the edge where order meets chaos.
Where divergence meets convergence.

Fractals describe patterns and recursion, cycles and iterations, the relationships
between countable, real, and complex. Mandelbrot set defines stability of a series
given a complex number C. Squaring Z, like when we square a wave function to find
the probability field, creates a wave function that we know converges. In other words,
the relationship between energy, frequency, position, and time.

Julia sets look at the same thing, but are about creating a stable ordering. I
think. I'm still learning, but they seem to be good at finding an order to a system,
so that you can pick a way to slice time that is stable.
