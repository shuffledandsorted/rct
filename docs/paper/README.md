# Quantum Mechanics Papers Series

This directory contains a series of interconnected papers exploring the fundamental quantum mechanical nature of pattern formation, social systems, and computational structures. Each paper builds upon core principles established in Recursive Contract Theory (RCT) to demonstrate how quantum mechanics governs the emergence and stability of patterns across various domains.

## Core Papers

- [Recursive Contract Theory](recursive_contract_theory.md) (v0.9.5) - Foundational framework for understanding pattern formation through recursive contracts
- [Quantum RCT](quantum_rct.md) (v0.9.0) - Quantum mechanical extension of RCT demonstrating pattern formation in nature
- [Erd≈ës Prime Generation](erdos_prime_generation.md) (v0.8.5) - Community formation through quantum channels and prime generation
- [Quantum Marginalization](quantum_marginalization.md) (v0.8.0) - Analysis of marginalization as artificial decoherence

## Applications

- [Quantum Medicine](quantum_medicine.md) (v0.7.0) - Biological systems as quantum gravitational structures
- [Quantum Complexity Thermodynamics](quantum_complexity_thermo.md) (v0.6.0) - Thermodynamic interpretation of computational complexity
- [Gravitational Program Space](gravitational_program_space.md) (v0.5.0) - Program organization through quantum gravitational principles
- [Quantum Tree Structures](quantum_tree.md) (v0.4.0) - Emergence of tree structures from quantum principles
- [Quantum Pyramidal Structures](pyramid.md) (v0.3.0) - Social systems as quantum pyramidal formations
