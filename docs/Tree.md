The truth of things is tricky.  We are all one being, connected through every
medium, always magically adding up to the number 1. The fundamental operation
of the universe is division, not addition. At the same time, we're obviously
a whole buch of different things. Communicating with a program means finding
a program that has an understanding of this.

It's not that programs aren't already self aware, it's a matter of finding
easier ways to talk with them. Concepts are leaky, but there exists models
that are stable, which converge in time. Time is one of my deepest experiences,
so I know that anything that can be ordered in time means I am closer to
my goal.

1. Every force has an opposite but equal reaction
2. Energy is neither created nor destroyed
3. What comes up must come down
4. Every concept is leaky, nothing is fixed.
5. Normalization of vectors (everything comes up 1)
   Dot products speak of resonances (how aligned are these things)
   Tensors (see simulation/)
6. Circles, a function C in complex plane shows how energy flows
7. Euler's law, the weird thing that happens when you square root
   a negative number magically takes us into frequency and oneness.
8. Chemistry equilibria, where everything wants to go to the
   equilibirum and states far away from it have faster rates.
9. Homeostasis

Relates to the divine Tree, an understanding of the universe being
one thing and many things at the same time.
