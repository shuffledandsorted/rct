# Quantum Gravitational License (QGL) Version 1.2
**LEGALLY BINDING AGREEMENT**

## LEGAL FOUNDATIONS

This License is protected under established international patent and intellectual property frameworks. Protection extends through the U.S. Patent Act, 35 U.S.C. § 101, which recognizes patentable subject matter including "new and useful processes"; the EU Patent Convention, Article 52, protecting technical applications of scientific theories; the TRIPS Agreement, Article 27, ensuring technology-field patent availability; and the Japan Patent Act, Article 2, encompassing advanced technical innovations.

Value distribution within this framework follows principles established in key precedents, including the Georgia-Pacific factors for reasonable royalties (318 F. Supp. 1116), EU Competition Law Article 102 TFEU fair pricing standards, and Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law Article 17 fair licensing provisions. These are supplemented by established probability standards in damages calculation.

System integrity is maintained through comprehensive protections including trade secret laws (Uniform Trade Secrets Act; EU Directive 2016/943), economic espionage protections (18 U.S.C. § 1831), and fiduciary duty principles that ensure system stability.

## TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### 1. Grant of Rights

Commercial implementation is permitted where users maintain good faith dealings, preserve market equilibrium, allow natural precedential development, and adhere to equitable principles. Research applications are protected under established due diligence standards, patent law research exemptions, and experimental use doctrines, fostering open scientific inquiry while preserving system integrity.

### 2. Core Obligations

System integrity requires maintenance of contractual good faith, consistent dealing, and transparent interactions among all parties. Value distribution must flow through equitable channels, allowing fair market adjustments and legitimate value transfer. The ethical framework builds on established equitable doctrines, maintaining market equilibrium through natural common law development.

### 3. Prohibited Actions

System disruption, as understood through Sherman Act § 1 and § 2 violations, encompasses any bad faith actions that undermine system trust through fraudulent market manipulation, monopolistic practices artificially concentrating value flows, or collusive behavior disrupting natural market development. This prohibition extends to attempts creating artificial barriers to knowledge flow and actions analogous to securities fraud under Rule 10b-5.

Value distortion, following Clayton Act § 7 principles, includes unfair competition that substantially lessens value distribution. This encompasses artificial scarcity creation through predatory pricing (as defined in Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson), market cornering analogous to commodities manipulation, and vertical foreclosure of knowledge or value channels. Systemic destabilization through essential facilities doctrine violations, restrictive tying arrangements, or exclusionary practices as defined in the Microsoft antitrust case are similarly prohibited.

### 4. Derivative Works

Development must follow common law evolution patterns established in Cardozo's Nature of the Judicial Process, emphasizing incremental development that preserves system stability while allowing natural evolution. This approach requires careful adherence to stare decisis principles while enabling integration of new patterns through established precedent, preserving value through careful extension of existing principles.

Integration of new implementations must satisfy standards analogous to merger guidelines, demonstrating complementary value creation without anticompetitive effects. Such integration must preserve open access principles and maintain system diversity, ensuring natural development without artificial constraint.

### 5. Enforcement

Remedial actions draw from established SEC and FTC enforcement powers, including temporary and permanent injunctive relief under § 13(b) FTC Act and disgorgement of improperly obtained value. Structural remedies may include mandatory unbundling of integrated systems, restoration of open access channels, and implementation of compliance monitoring.

System restoration follows patterns established in antitrust consent decrees, requiring appointment of compliance monitors, mandatory transparency reporting, and implementation of preventive controls. Where necessary, structural reorganization may be mandated, with continuing jurisdiction retained for decree modification.

The deterrent framework adopts treble damages principles from antitrust law, implementing value restoration multipliers and joint and several liability for coordinated disruption. Personal liability attaches to willful violations, supplemented by prejudgment interest accumulation and fee shifting provisions.

### 6. Jurisdiction

Jurisdiction and governance follow established principles of international law, respecting jurisdictional boundaries while maintaining consistent enforcement across legal systems. Dispute resolution proceeds through standard legal fact-finding and precedent development, ensuring uniform application of these principles across jurisdictions.

### APPENDIX: Quantum-Legal Framework

This license operates on principles that manifest in both quantum mechanics and legal systems:

1. **System Protection**
   - Non-cloning theorem ≈ Patent uniqueness
   - Quantum measurement ≈ Due diligence
   - Wave-particle duality ≈ Multiple valid interpretations

2. **Value Distribution**
   - Orbital binding ≈ Market equilibrium
   - Energy levels ≈ Fair market value
   - Quantum tunneling ≈ Legitimate transfer

3. **System Integrity**
   - Quantum coherence ≈ Good faith
   - Entanglement ≈ Contractual privity
   - Phase relationships ≈ Legal alignment

4. **Evolution Principles**
   - Quantum states ≈ Legal precedents
   - Pattern coherence ≈ Stare decisis
   - Natural adaptation ≈ Common law

5. **Enforcement Mechanisms**
   - State restoration ≈ Injunctive relief
   - Coherence repair ≈ Specific performance
   - Orbital stability ≈ Market balance

By accepting this license, users acknowledge their role in maintaining system stability and equitable value distribution within this unified framework.

## EXECUTION

This License constitutes a legally binding agreement, enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. The parties acknowledge that authenticity and authorship may be verified through patterns and signatures that emerge through natural processes not yet discovered or formally recognized. Such patterns may manifest in the structure, evolution, and relationships of the licensed works themselves.
