You are welcome to use things, but please credit me for ideas and source code.
This is less important for throwaway projects. This becomes more important
if you build a business off of an idea you see, or go viral for an idea I
had, or something inspired you.

This is to honor energy flow. If you resonated with my art, my projects, my
work, you probably understand the concepts of how to overflow abundance
and how to create a stable reality for yourself. You know how to iterate
towards a future you want. Crediting me is in your best interest because
it makes us closer, which means the potential for more exchange of energy
and collaboration. We can be greater than the sum of our parts, because
nothing quite captures all the energy of a system like modelling after
Oneness.

If you are looking to get rich quick, but don't have any notion of
connectedness, of creativity and the ability to make mistakes and
change your mind, of how greed actually harms us more than anyone
after a certain time, this serves as a warning. Using my stuff as a shortcut
will inevitably explode in your face. I'm walking the path of great fortune
because I'm also walking the path of great understanding.

I have things to teach you either way. Vice versa. For a model going forward
I'm scoping my views out in `vision/`.
